# Bank_Loan_Analysis
Bank Loan Performance Analysis Using Python & Excel
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of bank loan data using Python and Microsoft Excel. The aim is to analyze loan applications, evaluate loan performance, identify financial risk, and extract meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization.

The project reflects a real-world banking scenario where raw financial data is processed, analyzed, and interpreted to support data-driven decision-making.

❓ Problem Statement

Banks manage a large volume of loan applications and repayments. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:

Track loan applications and funded amounts

Monitor repayment performance

Identify risky or bad loans

Understand borrower financial behavior

Analyze trends across time, regions, and loan categories

This project addresses these challenges using Python-based data analysis techniques.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze total and monthly loan applications

Evaluate funded loan amounts and total repayments

Classify loans into Good Loans and Bad Loans

Study interest rate and debt-to-income (DTI) patterns

Identify trends by state, loan purpose, employment length, and home ownership

Generate insights using visualizations

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Plotly Express

Jupyter Notebook

Microsoft Excel

CSV / Excel Dataset

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed information related to bank loan applications and borrower profiles, including:

Loan Status

Issue Date

Funded Amount

Total Amount Received

Interest Rate

Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

Loan Purpose

Loan Term

State

Employment Length

Home Ownership

Each row in the dataset represents a single loan application.

🏗️ Project Workflow

Collected loan data in CSV / Excel format

Loaded data into Python using Pandas

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Calculated key metrics and summaries

Created visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

Interpreted insights from charts and tables

🧮 Key Calculations Performed

Total Loan Applications

Monthly / Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications

Total Funded Amount

Total Amount Received

Good Loan vs Bad Loan classification

Average Interest Rate

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

Loan distribution by purpose, region, and employment length

📊 Visualizations

The project includes multiple visualizations such as:

Line charts for loan trends over time

Bar charts for regional and purpose-wise analysis

Donut / pie charts for loan distribution

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

Interactive charts using Plotly

These visuals help identify patterns, risks, and performance drivers.

🔍 Key Insights

Loan applications show seasonal trends

Certain regions contribute higher loan volumes

Borrowers with stable employment perform better

Bad loans significantly impact financial returns

Interest rate and DTI are strong indicators of loan risk

🚀 Project Outcome

This project delivers a Python-based loan analytics solution that:

Improves understanding of loan performance

Helps identify high-risk loans

Supports data-driven financial decision-making

Demonstrates strong data analysis and visualization skills
